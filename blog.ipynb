    "I find blockchain fascinating because it extends open source software development to open source + state. This seems to be a genuine/exciting innovation in computing paradigms; We don't just get to share code, we get to share a running computer, and anyone anywhere can use it in an open and permissionless manner. The seeds of this revolution arguably began with Bitcoin, so I became curious to drill into it in some detail to get an intuitive understanding of how it works. And in the spirit of \"what I cannot create I do not understand\", what better way to do this than implement it from scratch?\n",

    "#### Step 1: generating a crypto identity\n",

    "First we want to generate a brand new cryptographic identity, which is just a private, public keypair. Bitcoin uses [Elliptic Curve Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography) instead of something more common like RSA to secure the transactions. I am not going to do a full introduction to ECC here because others have done a significantly better job, e.g. I found [Andrea Corbellini's blog post series](https://andrea.corbellini.name/2015/05/17/elliptic-curve-cryptography-a-gentle-introduction/) to be an exceptional resource. Here we are just going to write the code but to understand why it works mathematically you'd need to go through the series.\n",

    "Okay so Bitcoin uses the [secp256k1](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1) curve. As a newbie to the area I found this part fascinating - there are entire libraries of different curves you can choose from which offer different pros/cons and properties. NIST publishes recommendations on which ones to use, but people prefer to use other curves (like secp256k1) that are less likely to have backdoors built into them. Anyway, an elliptic curve is a fairly low dimensional mathematical object and takes only 3 integers to define:"

    "Okay the reason I wanted to implement this from scratch and paste it here is that I want you to note that again there is nothing too scary going on inside. SHA256 takes some bytes message that is to be hashed, it first pads the message, then breaks it up into chunks, and passes these chunks into what can best be described as a fancy \"bit mixer\", defined in section 3, that contains a number of bit shifts and binary operations orchestrated in a way that is frankly beyond me, but that results in the beautiful properties that SHA256 offers. In particular, it creates a fixed-sized, random-looking short digest of any variably-sized original message s.t. the scrambling is not invertible and also it is basically computationally impossible to construct a different message that hashes to any given digest. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin uses SHA256 everywhere to create hashes, and of course it is the core element in Bitcoin's Proof of Work, where the goal is to modify the block of transactions until the whole thing hashes to a sufficiently low number (when the bytes of the digest are interpreted as a number). Which, due to the nice properties of SHA256, can only be done via brute force search. So all of the ASICs designed for efficient mining are just incredibly optimized close-to-the-metal implementations of exactly the above code.\n",

This is just a Bitcoin-specific encoding of bytes that uses base 58, of characters of the alphabet that are very unambiguous. For example it does not use 'O' and '0', because they are very easy to mess up on paper. So we have to take our Bitcoin address (which is 25 bytes in its raw form) and convert it to base 58 and print out the characters. The raw 25 bytes of our address though contain 1 byte for a Version (the Bitcoin \"main net\" is `b'\\x00'`, while the Bitcoin \"test net\" uses `b'\\x6f'`), then the 20 bytes from the hash digest, and finally 4 bytes for a checksum so we can throw an error with `1 - 1/2**4 = 93.75%` probability in case a user messes up typing in their Bitcoin address into some textbox.

    "Ok great so our goal is to send some BTC from mnNcaVkC35ezZSgvn8fhXEa9QTHSUtPfzQ to mrFF91kpuRbivucowsY512fDnYt6BWrvx9. First, because we just generated these identities from scratch, the first address has no bitcoin on it. Because we are using the \"parallel universe\" developer-intended Bitcoin test network, we can use one of multiple available faucets to pretty please request some BTC. I did this by Googling \"bitcoin testnet faucet\", hitting the first link, and asking the faucet to send some bitcoins to our source address  mnNcaVkC35ezZSgvn8fhXEa9QTHSUtPfzQ. A few minutes later, we can go back to the blockchain explorer and see that we [received the coins](https://www.blockchain.com/btc-testnet/address/mnNcaVkC35ezZSgvn8fhXEa9QTHSUtPfzQ), in this case 0.001 BTC. Faucets are available for the test net, but of course you won't find them on the main net :) You'd have to e.g. open up a Coinbase account (which generates a wallet) and buy some BTC for USD. In this tutorial we'll be working on the test net, but everything we do would work just fine on the main net as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if we click on the exact [transaction ID](https://www.blockchain.com/btc-testnet/tx/46325085c89fb98a4b7ceee44eac9b955f09e1ddc86d8dad3dfdcba46b4d36b2) we can see a bunch of additional information that gets to the heart of Bitcoin and how money is represented in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transaction id**. First note that every transaction has a distinct id / hash. In this case the faucet transaction has id 46325085c89fb98a4b7ceee44eac9b955f09e1ddc86d8dad3dfdcba46b4d36b2. As we'll see, this is just a SHA256 double hash (hash of a hash) of the transaction data structure that we'll see soon serialized into bytes. Double SHA256 hashes are often used in place of a single hash in Bitcoin for added security, to mitigate a [few shortcomings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2#Comparison_of_SHA_functions) of just one round of SHA256, and some related attacks discovered on the older version of SHA (SHA-1).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inputs and Outputs**. We see that the faucet transaction has 1 input and 2 outputs. The 1 input came from address \n",
    "2MwjXCY7RRpo8MYjtsJtP5erNirzFB9MtnH of value 0.17394181 BTC. There were 2 outputs. The second output was our address and we received exactly 0.001 BTC. The first output is some different, unknown address 2NCorZJ6XfdimrFQuwWjcJhQJDxPqjNgLzG which received 0.17294013 BTC, and is presumably controlled by the faucet owners. Notice that the the inputs don't exactly add up to the outputs. Indeed we have that `0.17394181 - (0.001 + 0.17294013) = 0.00000168`. This \"change\" amount is called the fee, and this fee is allowed to claimed by the Bitcoin miner who has included this transaction in their block, which in this case was [Block 2005500](https://www.blockchain.com/btc-testnet/block/2005500). You can see that this block had 48 transactions, and the faucet transaction was one of them! Now, the fee acts as a financial incetive for miners to include the transaction in their block, because they get to keep the change. The higher the fee to the miner, the more likely and faster the transaction is to appear in the blockchain. With a high fee we'd expect it to be eagerly taken up by miners and included in the very next block. With a low fee the transaction might never be included, because there are many other transactions broadcasted in the network that are willing to pay a higher fee. So if you're a miner and you have a finite amount of space to put into your Block - why bother? \n",
    "\n",
    "When we make our own transaction, we'll have to make sure to include this tip for the miner, and pay \"market rate\", which we'll look up. In the case of this block, we can see that the total amount of BTC made by the miner of this block was 0.09765625 BTC from the special \"Coinbase\" transaction, that each miner is allowed to send from a null input to themselves, and then a total of 0.00316119 BTC was the total fee reward, summed up over all of the 47 non-Coinbase transactions in this block.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Size**. Also note that this transaction (serialized) was 249 bytes. This is a pretty average size for a simple transaction like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pkscript**. Lastly note that the second Output (our 0.001 BTC) when you scroll down to its details has a \"Pkscript\" field, which shows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "OP_DUP\n",
    "OP_HASH160\n",
    "4b3518229b0d3554fe7cd3796ade632aff3069d8\n",
    "OP_EQUALVERIFY\n",
    "OP_CHECKSIG\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where things get a bit crazy with Bitcoin. It has a whole stack-based scripting language, but unless you're doing crazy multisig smart contract triple escrow backflips (?), the vast majority of transactions use one of very few simple \"special case\" scripts, just like the one here. By now my eyes just glaze over it as the standard simple thing. This \"Pkscript\" is the \"locking script\" for this specific Output, which holds 0.001 BTC in it. We are going to want to spend this Output and turn it into an Input in our upcoming transaction. In order to unlock this output we are going to have to satisfy the conditions of this locking script. In English, this script is saying that any Transaction that aspires to spend this Output must satisfy two conditions. 1) their Public key better hash to 4b3518229b0d3554fe7cd3796ade632aff3069d8. And 2) the digital signature for the aspiring transaction better validate as being generated by this public key's associated private key. Only the owner of the secret key will be able to both 1) provide the full public key, which will be checked to hash correctly, and 2) create the digital signature, as we'll soon see.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, we can verify that of course our public key hashes correctly, so we'll be able to include it in our upcoming transaction, and the all of the mining nodes will be able to verify condition (1). Very early Bitcoin transactions had locking scripts that directly contained the public key (instead of its hash) followed by OP_CHECKSIG, but doing it in this slightly more complex way protects the exact public key behind the hash, until the owner wants to spend the funds, only then do they reveal the public key. (If you'd like to learn more look up p2pk vs p2pkh transactions)."

Once we consume this UTXO in its entirety we are free to \"chunk up\" its value into however many outputs we like, and optionally send some of those chunks back to our own address. Anyway, in this case we are identifying the transaction that sent us the Bitcoins, and we're saying that the Output we intend to spend is at the 1th index of it.

    "Now for the important part, we're looping around to specifying the `script_sig` of the transaction input `tx_in`, which we skipped over above. In particular we are going to craft a digital signature that effectively says \"I, the owner of the private key associated with the public key hash on the referenced transaction's output's locking script approve the spend of this UTXO as an input of this transaction\". Unfortunately this is again where Bitcoin gets pretty fancy because you can actually only sign parts of Transactions, and a number of signatures can be assembled from a number of parties and combined in various ways. As we did above, we will only cover the (by far) most common use case of signing the entire transaction and, and constructing the unlocking script specifically to only satisfy the locking script of the exact form above (OP_DUP, OP_HASH160, \\<hash\\>, OP_EQUALVERIFY, OP_CHECKSIG).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to create a pure bytes \"message\" that we will be digitally signing. In this case, the message is the encoding of the entire transaction. So this is awkward - the entire transaction can't be encoded into bytes yet because we haven't finished it! It is still missing our signature, which we are still trying to construct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, when we are serializing the transaction input that we wish to sign, the rule is to replace the encoding of the `script_sig` (which we don't have, because again we're just trying to produce it...) with the `script_pubkey` of the transaction output this input is pointing back to. All other transaction input's `script_sig` is also replaced with an empty script, because those inputs can belong to many other owners who can individually and independently contribute their own signatures. Ok I'm not sure if this is making sense any right now. So let's just see it in code.\n",
    "    \n",
    "We need the final datastructure, the actual Transaction, so we can serialize it into the bytes message. It is mostly a thin container for a list of `TxIn`s and list of `TxOut`s: the inputs and outputs. We then implement the serialization for the new `Tx` class, and also the serialization for `TxIn` and `TxOut` class, so we can serialize the entire transaction to bytes."

In particular, we are of course not including the `script_sig` of any of the other inputs when we are signing a specific input (you can see that the `txin_encode` function will set them to be empty scripts).

However, the code is somewhat long and not super exciting (it's a lot of serialization following the specific message formats described in the [Bitcoin protocol](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation)), so instead of further bloating this notebook I will use blockstream's helpful [tx/push](https://blockstream.info/testnet/tx/push) endpoint to broadcast the transaction. It's just a large textbox where we copy paste the raw transaction hex exactly as above, and hit \"Broadcast\". If you'd like to do this manually with raw Bitcoin protocol you'd want to look into my [SimpleNode](https://github.com/karpathy/cryptos/blob/main/cryptos/network.py) implementation and use that to communicate to a node over socket.\n"

However, I hope this acts as a good intro to the core concepts of how value is represented in Bitcoin, and how cryptography is used to secure the transactions.\n",

    "In essence, we have a DAG of UTXOs that each have a certain `amount` and a locking `Script`, transactions fully consume and create UTXOs, and they are packaged into blocks by miners every 10 minutes. Economics is then used to achieve decentralization via proof of work: the probability that any entity gets to add a new block to the chain is proportional to their fraction of the network's total SHA256 hashing power.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I was writing my [karpathy/cryptos](https://github.com/karpathy/cryptos) library it was fun to reflect on where all of the code was going. The majority of the cryptographic complexity comes from ECC, ECDSA, and SHA256, which are relatively standard in the industry and you'd never want to actually implement yourself (\"don't roll your own crypto\"). On top of this, the core data structures of transactions, blocks, etc. are fairly straight forward, but there are a lot of non-glamorous details around the Bitcoin protocol, and the serialization / deserialization of all the data structures to and from bytes. On top of this, Bitcoin is a living, breathing, developing code base that is moving forward with new features to continue to scale, to further fortify its security, all while maintaining full backwards compatibility to avoid hard forks. Sometimes, respecting these constraints leads to some fairly gnarly constructs, e.g. I found Segwit in particular to not be very aesthetically pleasing to say the least. Other times, there is a large amount of complexity (e.g. with the scripting language and all of its op codes) that is rarely used in the majority of the basic point to point transactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, I really enjoyed various historical aspects of Bitcoin. For example I found it highly amusing that some of the original satoshi bugs are still around, e.g. in how the mining difficulty is adjusted (there is an off by one error where the calculation is based on 2015 blocks instead of 2016), or how some of the op codes are buggy (e.g. original multisig). Or how some of the primordial satoshi ideas around high frequency trades (locktime / sequence) are still around, but find only limited use in a likely not-exactly-intended ways. Bitcoin is a code base with all the struggles of any other software project, but without the ability to break legacy functionality (this would require a hard fork).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you'd like to dig deeper I found [Mastering Bitcoin](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Bitcoin-Programming-Open-Blockchain/dp/1491954388) and [Programming Bitcoin](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Bitcoin-Learn-Program-Scratch/dp/1492031496) to be very helpful references. I also implemented a much cleaner, separated, tested and more extensive version of everything above in my repo [karpathy/cryptos](https://github.com/karpathy/cryptos) if you'd like to use that as a reference instead in your own blockchain journey. I'll make sure to upload this notebook there as well. Oh and find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/karpathy).\n",
